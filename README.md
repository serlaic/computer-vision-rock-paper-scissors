# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 1

* Teachable machine trains a computer to detect whether the user is showing Rock, Paper, Scissors to the camera.
* Creates 4 different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing
* Training uses default parameters
    * Epochs : 50
    * Batch Size : 16
    * Learning Rate: 0.001
* Exports model filename: keras_model.h5 which contains a structure and the parameters of deep learning model.
* Model will be used in a future project for game called Rock Paper Scissors where the user will be able to show his choice to the camera.
* Python Programming Language will be used in this project
